# Simple Ransomware Implementation

This repository contains a simple ransomware implementation in Go. It demonstrates basic functionalities for encrypting and decrypting PDF files using AES encryption.

## Instructions

1. First, run the encryption script by executing the following command: go run enc.go

This will encrypt all PDF files in the 'pdfs' folder.

2. After encryption, navigate to the 'pdfs' folder to see the encrypted files.

3. To decrypt the files, run the decryption script by executing the following command: go run dec.go

4. The decrypted files will be saved in the 'pdfs' folder without the '.enc' extension.

**Note:** Ensure that you have Go installed on your system to execute the scripts.
